FUNCTIONS:
This script will reserve a campsite for you at kirk creek campground in big sur
this campground is notoriously difficult to get a reservation at which is the reason I created this
reservations open each day at 10AM for a date six months in advance so you need to plan ahead
weekend sites will all be booked within 10 minutes so this is likely not the only automated script being used to reserve here

VARIABLES:
you will need to have an account at the site (recreation.gov)
enter your login information as well as credit card info and reservation details (number of people/vehicles)
this script will take the FIRST AVAILABLE camp site - it is not set up to get a specific site

REQUIREMENTS:
python 2.7, webdriver, recreation.gov account, credit card

NOTE:
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND running this from a cronjob from your machine at 10:01 AM
If there are no sites available it should be able to navigate to the next page and grab one from page 2
There is also a pop-up that occurs at random times but the script shuold be able to move past it
you can see the script in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbvBkXGdtGA
